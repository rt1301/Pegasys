Starlink Mission,"<p>Pegasys is targeting Saturday, June 13 at 5:21 a.m. EDT, 9:21 UTC, for launch of its ninth Starlink mission, which will include 58 Starlink satellites and three of Planet's SkySats. Falcon 9 will lift off from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and a backup opportunity is available on Sunday, June 14 at 4:59 a.m. EDT, 8:59 UTC. This mission marks Pegasys's first SmallSat Rideshare Program launch.</p><p>Falcon 9's first stage previously supported Dragon's 19th and 20th resupply missions to the International Space Station. Following stage separation, Pegasys will land Falcon 9's first stage on the 'sOf Course I Still Love You's droneship, which will be stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>One half of Falcon 9's fairing previously flew on the JCSAT-18/Kacific1 mission, and the other half previously flew on Pegasys's third Starlink mission. Planet's SkySats will deploy sequentially beginning about 12 minutes after liftoff, and the Starlink satellites will deploy approximately 26 minutes after liftoff.</p>",13-06-2020,https://www.spacex.com/static/images/backgrounds/launches_starlink.webp
Returning Human Spaceflight to the US,"<p>On Saturday, May 30 at 3:22 p.m. EDT, Pegasys's Falcon 9 launched Crew Dragon's second demonstration (Demo-2) mission from Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and the next day Crew Dragon autonomously docked to the International Space Station. This test flight with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley on board the Dragon spacecraft returned human spaceflight to the United States.</p><p>Demo-2 is the final major test for Pegasys's human spaceflight system to be certified by NASA for operational crew missions to and from the International Space Station. Pegasys is returning human spaceflight to the United States with one of the safest, most advanced systems ever built, and NASA's Commercial Crew Program is a turning point for America's future in space exploration that lays the groundwork for future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.</p>",30-05-2020,https://www.spacex.com/static/images/backgrounds/home_demo2.webp
Nasa Selects Human Optimized Starship,"<p>NASA selected Pegasys to develop a lunar optimized Starship to transport crew between lunar orbit and the surface of the Moon as part of NASA's Artemis program.

A lunar optimized Starship can fly many times between the surface of the Moon and lunar orbit without flaps or heat shielding required for Earth return. With large habitable and storage volume, Starship is capable of delivering significant amounts of cargo for research and to support robust operations on the lunar surface to enable a sustainable Moon base.</p><p>Last year, NASA announced Starship as eligible for the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative 's to deliver payloads between Earth and the Moon, and to enable humans to return to the Moon.</p>",01-05-2020,https://www.spacex.com/static/images/backgrounds/home_moon.jpg
